                            <p>We are the largest Bicycle seller in India. We are actively helping people since 50 years.
                               Build on high quality image of its products by investing in R&D, innovation and automation, while consolidating on a competent & empowered people resource. Pursue excellence in internal processes and optimize use of its assets. Serve communities in the area of health and education. In customer relations, the company prefers to stay a shade different from the rest. By internalising the phenomenon called customer it relies on his feedback. Many of its innovations are born in such a co-operative environment. ‘Aap ne sujhaayi, hum ne banaayi’ meaning ‘we made it exactly as per your suggestion’ has been its advertising refrain. The company encourages and suitably acknowledges such inputs.
